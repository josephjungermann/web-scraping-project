      <p><strong>By Joseph Jungermann (<a href="https://twitter.com/j_mann29">@j_mann29</a>)</strong></p>
      <p>Millions of Americans have filed for unemployment due to the COVID-19 pandemic. New Yorkers living in the hardest-hit state in the nation are continuing to deal with the devastating economic impact of the virus.</p>
      <p>There is perhaps no greater indication of the Coronavirus's effect on New York's workforce than the data presented by the New York State Department of Labor's <a href="https://labor.ny.gov/workforcenypartners/warn/warnportal.shtm">"Worker
          Adjustment and Retraining Notification"</a> site.</p>
      <p>The Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988 (or simply, the "WARN Act"), was developed to protect employees and their families by requiring employers that meet certain criteria to give advance notification of plant closings
        and mass layoffs of employees.</p>
      <p><iframe title="Total Employees Affected by WARN Notices Due to COVID-19" aria-label="Interactive area chart" id="datawrapper-chart-XcVyj" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/XcVyj/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"
          style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="400"></iframe>
        <script type="text/javascript">
          ! function() {
            "use strict";
            window.addEventListener("message", (function(a) {
              if (void 0 !== a.data["datawrapper-height"])
                for (var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]) {
                  var t = document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-" + e) || document.querySelector("iframe[src*='" + e + "']");
                  t && (t.style.height = a.data["datawrapper-height"][e] + "px")
                }
            }))
          }();
        </script>
      </p>
      <p>According to New York State's Department of Labor, The WARN Act applies to private businesses that have 50 or more full-time workers. Employers are required to give all affected employees, any employee representatives, The New York State
        Department of Labor (DOL) and The Local Workforce Investment Board (LWIB) a 90-day advanced notice of layoffs.</p>
      <p>This includes closings that affect 25 or more workers, mass layoffs involving at least 33% of all the workers at the site or 250 or more full-time workers.</p>
      <p>The WARN Act is meant to give the Department of Labor a chance to work with affected employees and give them information about unemployment insurance options while providing resources to help them get back into the workforce. </p>
      <p>The outbreak of COVID-19 has caused employers all over New York State to file WARN notices in response to mass layoffs and business shutdowns, and some industries have been hit harder than others.</p>

          style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="435"></iframe>
        <script type="text/javascript">
          ! function() {
            "use strict";
            window.addEventListener("message", (function(a) {
              if (void 0 !== a.data["datawrapper-height"])
                for (var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]) {
                  var t = document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-" + e) || document.querySelector("iframe[src*='" + e + "']");
                  t && (t.style.height = a.data["datawrapper-height"][e] + "px")
                }
            }))
          }();
        </script>
      </p>
      <p>Governor Cuomo's lockdown is likely to extend way past the current May 15 deadline, and with a COVID-19 vaccine a long way away, the industries decimated by layoffs will take years to recover.</p>
      <p>The federal government has pumped billions of dollars into the Small Business Administration's disaster relief programs, such as the "Paycheck Protection Program" and the "Economic Injury Disaster Loan Program," as a way to incentivize
        business
        owners to hold onto their employees.</p>
      <p>But a majority of owners could not weather the storm, and the workers who have suffered as a result will be facing a tough road ahead when returning to a job market that will be crowded once the pandemic has ended.</p>
